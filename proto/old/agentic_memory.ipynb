    "\n",
    "LLMs are considered \"stateless\" in that every time you invoke an LLM call, it is like the first time it's ever seen the input being passed through. Given this quirk, multi-turn LLM agents have a unique challenge to overcome with fully understanding and navigating a vast world model which we humans do naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a human has a lot of advantages over a language model when executing a task. We bring our general knowledge about the world and lived experience, our understanding of prior similar task experiences and their takeaways, what we've specifically learned how to do or been taught, and then our ability to instantly contextualize and shape our approach to a task as we're working through it. In essence, we have advanced memory and the ability to learn from and apply learnings to new experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs sort of have some memory, mostly their general knowledge or traits picked up from training and additional fine tuning but suffer from a lack of the other characteristics outlined prior. To compensate for this, we can model different forms of memory, recall, and learning within our agentic system design. Specifically, we'll create a simple RAG agent to model 4 kinds of memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working Memory** - Current conversation and immediate context\n",
    "- **Episodic Memory** - Historical experiences and their takeaways\n",
    "- **Semantic Memory** - Knowledge context and factual grounding\n",
    "- **Procedural Memory** - The \"rules\" and \"skills\" for interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "These four memory systems provide a holistic approach to understanding and architecting a part of cognitive design into an agent application. In this notebook we'll break down each type of memory and an example approach to implementing them into a whole agent experience."

Learning in episodic memory happens through two processes: automatic storage of complete conversations, and generation of post-conversation analysis.

This dual approach enables both specific recall and strategic learning for future conversations.\n",

    "Semantic memory represents our structured knowledge of facts, concepts, and their relationships - essentially what we \"know\" rather than what we \"remember experiencing.\" This type of memory allows us to understand and interact with the world by accessing our accumulated knowledge. For a chatbot, semantic memory would consist of its knowledge base and retrieval system, containing documentation, technical information, and general knowledge that can be accessed to provide accurate and informed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference from episodic memory is that semantic memory isn't tied to specific experiences or events - it's about understanding concepts and facts in an abstract way. In an AI system, this would be implemented through techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where relevant information is dynamically pulled from a knowledge base to ground and inform responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning in semantic memory involves expanding and refining the knowledge base - adding new information, updating existing entries, and broadening coverage of different topics. This could mean incorporating new documentation, updating technical specifications, or expanding the range of topics the system can knowledgeably discuss. The act of remembering then becomes a process of retrieving and synthesizing relevant information from this knowledge base to provide accurate and contextual responses.\n",

    "This semantic knowledge can then be combined with the current conversation context (working memory) and past similar interactions (episodic memory) to provide comprehensive, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses.

Those who habitually \\nbinge on processed foods when they feel hungry or have cravings may struggle initially with maintaining food \\nquality while practicing intermittent fasting. Having quality meals and snacks on hand and ready to eat when the \\nfast ends is key for experiencing success with a fasting protocol. << Table of Contents\\u2003\\nTactics\\nCrossFit Nutrition I Training Guide\\u2003V1.3   |  69 of 115\\nCopyright © 2022 CrossFit, LLC.

Flexible dieting is also less rigorous in \\nterms of balancing meals, as the macronutrient ratios apply only to total food consumed over the course of the \\nday rather than balancing at each meal as per our recommendations.\\nA popular way to determine total food consumed and the macronutrient ratio for a flexible diet plan involves \\ncalculating the total daily calories required and then adjusting this number up or down based on the primary \\ngoal: weight loss or weight gain. The overall macronutrient ratio is then derived from suggested percentages of\\nCHUNK 8:\\nbenchmarks against which to track your progress.

    "\n",
    "Procedural memory is different from working, semantic, and episodic memory since it covers more how we actually remember to perform tasks or follow a familiar routine, i.e. riding a bike or typing on a keyboard. It's the \"how to do things\" type of memory, distinct from factual knowledge (semantic) or specific experiences (episodic). This memory system enables us to execute complex sequences of actions without conscious recall of each individual step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of an LLM agent, procedural memory more abstractly consists of both its underlying language model weights and the framework code that defines information processing and response generation. The key difference from other memory types is that procedural memory encompasses the fundamental operations that make the system work - the core mechanisms that drive its behavior and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes two explicit forms: the learned patterns stored in the language model's weights from training, and the structured codebase that orchestrates memory interactions and shapes system behavior. Learning in procedural memory occurs through two main paths: adjustments to the language model's weights via fine-tuning or training, and updates to the system's core code. While fine-tuning enhances the model's language understanding and generation, code modifications can strengthen operations, enhance retrieval methods, or introduce new capabilities. These changes require careful implementation as they alter the system's fundamental operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedural foundation also enables the integration of all memory systems. The language model's weights provide essential language processing abilities, while the framework code coordinates between working memory's current context, episodic memory's past experiences, and semantic memory's knowledge base. This architecture allows the system to transform understanding into effective action."

      "AI Message:  That's great, David! Starting intermittent fasting can be an effective way to manage weight and improve overall health. Since you're just starting out, here's a quick overview of what to expect and some tips to help you along the way:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adaptation Period**: It typically takes two to four weeks for your body to adjust to intermittent fasting. During this time, you might experience decreased energy, headaches, or hunger pangs, but these should resolve as your body adapts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Herbal teas or black coffee can also help manage hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Meal Quality**: Focus on eating high-quality foods during your eating window. Lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables are great choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Start Slowly**: If you're trying a 16:8 method, you might begin with a 12-hour fasting window and gradually increase it to 16 hours as you become more comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Stay Busy**: Keeping active during fasting periods can help distract from hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds and adjust your fasting protocol as needed. If you feel too fatigued or unwell, consider consulting a healthcare professional.\n",

      "AI Message:  If you're planning to go for a run soon after waking up and haven't had breakfast yet, here are a few suggestions to help you make the most of your run:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hydration**: Start with a glass of water to hydrate yourself after a night's sleep. Proper hydration is essential for optimal performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Light Snack**: If you're feeling a bit hungry or need some energy, consider having a small, easily digestible snack. A banana or a few almonds can provide quick energy without causing discomfort during your run.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Warm-Up**: Spend a few minutes warming up your body with dynamic stretches or light jogging in place. This helps prepare your muscles and reduces the risk of injury.\n",

      "HUMAN: What is the best way to lose weight\n",
      "AI: The best way to lose weight is to combine a balanced diet with regular exercise, while ensuring a sustainable and healthy approach. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Balanced Diet**: Focus on consuming whole, unprocessed foods, such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Aim for a caloric deficit where you consume fewer calories than you burn, but not so low that it becomes unhealthy or unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exercise**: Incorporate both cardio and strength training exercises into your routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Strength training is important for preserving lean body mass while losing weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lifestyle Factors**: Ensure you get adequate sleep, manage stress effectively, and stay hydrated. These factors can significantly impact your weight loss journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Intermittent Fasting**: Some people find success with intermittent fasting, which involves eating within a specific time window. However, this approach may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who are very active, stressed, or have eating disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Track Progress**: Use methods like the eyeball method or more precise measurements to track food intake and progress over time. Focus on body composition rather than just weight, as muscle gain can offset fat loss on the scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consistency and Patience**: Sustainable weight loss takes time. Avoid the temptation for quick fixes, as rapid weight loss can be unhealthy and often unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consulting a healthcare professional or a dietitian can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific needs and health conditions.\n",
      "HUMAN: can you create a rountine for me?\n",
      "AI: Based on the grounded context provided, let's create a routine focusing on nutrition and exercise for optimal health and fitness:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Nutrition Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Balanced Diet Principles**:\n",
      "   - Consume a variety of foods: meat, vegetables, nuts, seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar.\n",
      "   - Focus on whole, unprocessed foods to create a platform for performance and health.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Macronutrient Ratios**:\n",
      "   - Use the Zone Diet approach for precision: 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat.\n",
      "   - Consider eating five meals a day (three meals and two snacks) with appropriate portion sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Meal Planning**:\n",
      "   - Weigh and measure your food for accuracy, especially if you aim to optimize fitness.\n",
      "   - Use the palm method as a guide for portion sizes: a palm-sized portion of protein is approximately 4 oz.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Flexible Dieting**:\n",
      "   - Adjust macronutrient intake and ratios to match personal preferences, such as lower carbs and higher fat if desired.\n",
      "   - Track total consumption and adjust over time based on results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Social Eating**:\n",
      "   - When dining out, request food to be cooked without undesirable oils, and ask for sauces or dressings on the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Exercise Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cardiovascular Exercise**:\n",
      "   - Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, or swimming).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Strength Training**:\n",
      "   - Incorporate strength training exercises at least two times per week.\n",
      "   - Focus on major muscle groups: legs, back, chest, shoulders, arms, and core.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Activity Level**:\n",
      "   - Adjust your exercise routine based on your activity level using the Zone Diet scale: \n",
      "     - 0.5 for sedentary, \n",
      "     - 0.6 for light activity, \n",
      "     - 0.7 for moderate activity, \n",
      "     - 0.8 for active, \n",
      "     - 0.9 for very active, \n",
      "     - 1.0 for elite athlete.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rest and Recovery**:\n",
      "   - Ensure you get adequate rest and recovery time between workouts to prevent overtraining and injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hydration**:\n",
      "   - Stay hydrated, but avoid myths like drinking until urine is clear. Listen to your body's thirst cues.\n",
      "\n",
      "This routine is a general guideline and can be adjusted based on your personal goals, preferences, and any specific dietary or exercise needs. For a more personalized plan, consider consulting a fitness or nutrition professional.\n",
      "HUMAN: okay lets dive into more specifics for cardio based activities and foods i should be eating\n",
      "AI: ### Cardio-Based Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Running or Jogging**: Start with brisk walking and gradually increase to jogging or running as your fitness level improves. This is a highly effective way to burn calories and improve cardiovascular fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cycling**: Whether using a stationary bike or cycling outdoors, this activity is great for improving leg strength and cardiovascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Swimming**: A full-body workout that is easy on the joints. It improves cardiovascular endurance and muscle tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rowing**: Engages multiple muscle groups and provides an excellent cardiovascular workout.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: Involves short bursts of intense activity followed by rest or low-intensity periods. It's efficient for burning calories and improving cardiovascular fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Jump Rope**: A simple yet effective cardio exercise that can be done anywhere. It helps improve coordination and cardiovascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Foods to Include in Your Diet\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lean Proteins**: Include sources like chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, and legumes to support muscle repair and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Whole Grains**: Opt for whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat bread for sustained energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fruits and Vegetables**: A variety of colorful fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Healthy Fats**: Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil for heart health and satiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dairy or Alternatives**: Include low-fat dairy products or alternatives like almond milk or soy milk for calcium and vitamin D.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Hydration**: Stay hydrated with water, and consider electrolyte-rich beverages if engaging in prolonged or intense exercise sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Limit Processed Foods**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods to maximize nutrient intake and maintain energy levels.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/mem_gpt.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "MemGPT is a system that enables large language models (LLMs) to handle context beyond their fixed context window limits by implementing a hierarchical memory system inspired by traditional operating systems. Just as operating systems use virtual memory to page data between physical memory and disk, MemGPT manages different storage tiers to effectively extend an LLM's limited context window. The system has three main memory components: a read-only system instructions section, a read/write working context for storing key information, and a FIFO queue for message history - all within the LLM's main context window (analogous to RAM). When this main context approaches capacity, MemGPT can move less immediately relevant information to external \"archival storage\" and \"recall storage\" (analogous to disk storage). The system uses function calls to intelligently manage what information stays in the main context versus what gets moved to external storage, and can retrieve relevant information back into the main context when needed through search and pagination mechanisms.\n",

    "<img src=\"./media/voyager.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Voyager is an autonomous AI agent that explores and learns to play Minecraft using GPT-4 as its core reasoning engine. Its memory and learning system centers around three key components: an automatic curriculum that proposes appropriately challenging tasks based on the agent's current capabilities, a skill library that stores successful code programs as reusable skills, and an iterative prompting mechanism that refines actions through environmental feedback. The skill library acts as Voyager's long-term memory, where each mastered skill is stored as executable code indexed by embeddings of its description, allowing relevant skills to be retrieved and composed into more complex behaviors when facing new challenges. Through this system, Voyager accumulates knowledge by storing successful code patterns rather than relying on traditional parameter updates or gradient-based learning, enabling it to continually build upon its capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. This approach allows Voyager to organically explore and master increasingly sophisticated tasks, from basic resource gathering to complex tool crafting, while maintaining the ability to reuse and adapt its learned skills in new situations.\n",

    "<img src=\"./media/tim.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "TiM (Think-in-Memory) is a memory mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables more consistent long-term memory by storing and recalling thoughts rather than raw conversation history. Instead of repeatedly reasoning over past conversations, TiM operates in two key stages: first, it recalls relevant thoughts from memory before generating a response, and second, it performs \"post-thinking\" after generating a response to update its memory with new thoughts. These thoughts are stored using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient retrieval and organization. The system supports three main operations: inserting new thoughts, forgetting unnecessary ones, and merging similar thoughts. By storing processed thoughts rather than raw conversations, TiM avoids the inconsistency problems that can arise from repeatedly reasoning over the same history in different ways, while also making retrieval more efficient since it only needs to search within relevant thought clusters.\n",

    "#### [Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02151)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/retroformer.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Retroformer is a framework for improving large language model (LLM) agents through a plug-in retrospective model that automatically refines agent prompts based on environmental feedback. Its memory system works through three components: 1) short-term memory from the trajectory history of the current episode, 2) long-term memory from self-reflection responses that summarize prior failed attempts and are appended to the actor prompt, and 3) a replay buffer that stores triplets of reflection prompts, responses, and episode returns across different tasks and environments. The retrospective model uses policy gradient optimization to learn from these memories - it analyzes failed attempts, generates reflective feedback, and updates its parameters to produce better prompting that helps the agent avoid past mistakes. Rather than trying to modify the core LLM agent (which remains frozen), Retroformer focuses on optimizing this retrospective component to provide better guidance through refined prompts, allowing the agent to improve over time while maintaining its original capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/memorybank.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "MemoryBank is a long-term memory system designed for Large Language Models that consists of three core components: a memory storage system, a memory retrieval mechanism, and a memory updating system inspired by human cognition. The memory storage maintains detailed conversation logs, event summaries, and evolving user personality profiles in a hierarchical structure. When new interactions occur, a dual-tower dense retrieval model (similar to Dense Passage Retrieval) encodes both the current context and stored memories into vector representations, then uses FAISS indexing to efficiently retrieve relevant past information. The system uniquely incorporates an Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve-based updating mechanism that allows memories to naturally decay over time unless reinforced through repeated recall, mimicking human memory patterns. The memory strength is modeled as a discrete value that increases when information is recalled, with memories becoming more resistant to forgetting through repeated access. This comprehensive approach enables LLMs to maintain context over extended periods, understand user personalities, and provide more personalized interactions while simulating natural memory retention and decay patterns."
